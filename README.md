## Notion ID [option]
Notion ID is the your notion site ID that you want to share the file to.
if you don't write it, notion will share to the default link like: 
https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/a8aec43384f447ed84390 
that visit this page need to redirect to your site url 
if you write the Notion ID, it will share to the page link like: 
https://your_user_name.notion.site/myworkspace/a8aec43384f447ed84390. 
The visiter don't need to redirect url.
